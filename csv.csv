['1. Which muscles control the movement of the eye', 'allowing it to scan objects in the visual field and maintain focus on targets?\n- Superior oblique', 'Inferior oblique', 'Superior rectus', 'Inferior rectus', 'Medial rectus', "Lateral rectus\n\n2. How does the eye's movement differ from the movement of an object or a head during motion?\n- The image on the retina remains stable in the central fovea (fovea centralis)", 'enhancing the ability to distinguish fine differences', 'especially in low vision conditions.\n\n3. What roles do these muscles play beyond controlling eye movements?\n- They contribute to the accommodation process', 'which involves changing the crystalline lens curvature to adjust focus based on distance variations. When looking at nearby objects', "the eyelid muscles contract to increase the eye's power of accommodation", 'allowing clearer images to focus on the fovea centralis.\n\n4. In summary', 'what is the role of muscles in controlling eye movements and other visual functions?\n- Muscles coordinate eye movements to respond to environmental objects', 'as well as contribute to maintaining clear and stable vision and facilitating visual accommodation for near and far objects. When looking at nearby objects', "the eyelid muscles contract to increase the eye's power of accommodation", 'allowing clearer images to focus on the fovea centralis.']
