What are the two main factors contributing to cellular aging?,The two main factors contributing to cellular aging are genetic abnormalities and exposure to exogenous influences.,"['Cellular Aging', 'Genetic Abnormalities', 'Exposure', 'Exogenous Influences']",Cellular Aging
What is the result of the accumulation of cellular and molecular damage in cells?,The result of the accumulation of cellular and molecular damage in cells is a decline in cellular function and viability.,"['Cellular Aging', 'Accumulation', 'Cellular Damage', 'Molecular Damage', 'Decline']",Cellular Aging
What are the two types of damage that contribute to cellular aging?,The two types of damage that contribute to cellular aging are genetic abnormalities and damage caused by exposure to exogenous influences.,"['Cellular Aging', 'Genetic Abnormalities', 'Exposure', 'Exogenous Influences']",Cellular Aging
What are telomeres?,Telomeres are the protective caps at the end of chromosomes that prevent the loss of genetic information during cell division.,"['telomeres', 'protective caps']",Telomeres
What is the role of telomerase in cells?,"Telomerase is an enzyme that adds new telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes, maintaining their length and preventing cellular aging.","['telomerase', 'enzyme']",Telomerase
What is replicative senescence?,Replicative senescence is the process by which cells can no longer divide and grow due to the shortening of their telomeres.,['replicative senescence'],Replicative Senescence
How are telomeres related to replicative senescence?,"The shortening of telomeres during cell division triggers replicative senescence, preventing the cell from dividing further.","['telomeres', 'replicative senescence']",Telomeres and Replicative Senescence
Why is the maintenance of telomeres and telomerase important for cells?,"The maintenance of telomeres and telomerase is essential for cells to maintain their ability to divide and grow, preventing cellular aging and senescence.","['telomeres', 'telomerase', 'cellular aging']",Importance of Telomeres and Telomerase
What happens to cells when they are stressed beyond their tolerance level?,Cell injury (reversible or irreversible) develops.,"['cell injury', 'stress']",Cell Injury
What is the outcome of irreversible cell injury?,Necrosis is the result.,"['irreversible injury', 'necrosis']",Irreversible Cell Injury
What are the specific patterns of necrosis?,"Coagulative, liquefactive, gangrenous, caseous, fat, and fibrinoid are the types.","['necrosis', 'types']",Types of Necrosis
What is apoptosis?,Apoptosis is individual cell death.,['apoptosis'],Apoptosis
How does apoptosis occur?,"It is characterized by enzymatic degradation of proteins and DNA, initiated by caspases, and the recognition and removal of dead cells by phagocytes.","['apoptosis', 'mechanisms']",Mechanisms of Apoptosis
What are the mechanisms that cause cell injury?,"Hypoxia and ischemia lead to ATP depletion, ischemia-reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, protein misfolding, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and membrane damage.","['cell injury', 'mechanisms']",Cell Injury Mechanisms
What are adaptations in biology?,"Adaptations are reversible changes in the size, number, phenotype, or functions of cells in response to changes in their environment.",,Adaptations
What causes abnormal deposits of materials in cells and tissues?,Abnormal deposits of materials in cells and tissues are the result of excessive intake or defective transport or catabolism.,,Abnormal Deposits
What is pathologic calcification?,Pathologic calcification is the abnormal tissue deposition of calcium salts.,,Pathologic Calcification
What causes cellular aging?,"Cellular aging results from a combination of accumulating cellular damage, reduced capacity to divide, and reduced ability to repair damaged DNA.",,Cellular Aging
