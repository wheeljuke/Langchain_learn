This improves fine detail discrimination, especially in low vision conditions.","['eye movement', 'stability']"
2,3,Eye Muscles and Accommodation,What role do eye muscles play in visual accommodation?,Eye muscles not only control eye movement but also participate in the accommodation process. This involves changing the curvature of the lens to adjust focus according to distance changes.,"['eye muscles', 'accommodation']"
3,4,Eye Adaptation and Focusing,How does the eye adjust focus when looking at objects at different distances?,"The eyes change their curvature by using the ciliary muscle and the accommodating lens to increase or decrease their power, allowing clear images to form on the fovea centralis.","['eye adaptation', 'focusing']"
